RocksDB is a storage engine with key/value interface, where keys and values are arbitrary byte streams. It is a C++ library. 
It was developed at Facebook based on LevelDB and provides backwards-compatible support for LevelDB APIs.

RocksDB supports various storage hardware, with fast flash as the initial focus. 
It uses a Log Structured Database Engine for storage, is written entirely in C++, and has a Java wrapper called RocksJava. See RocksJava Basics.

RocksDB can adapt to a variety of production environments, including pure memory, Flash, hard disks or remote storage. 
Where RocksDB cannot automatically adapt, highly flexible configuration settings are provided to allow users to tune it for them. 
It supports various compression algorithms and good tools for production support and debugging.
